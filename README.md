# Counter Thing

## Client

- Vanilla JS (TS)
- Vite as build tool
- Volta as toolchain manager

### Developing

- In `./client`:
  - Use `npm install` to install frontend dependencies (for instance, after cloning the repo)
  - Use `npm run dev` to host the frontend locally with hot-reloading.

### Frontend Structure

- [./client/public/](./client/public/): Special assets (see <https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets#the-public-directory>)
- [./client/src/](./client/src/): Client-side code and normal assets
